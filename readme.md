# YOLOv11 Intrusion Warning System

## Overview
This project implements an **Intrusion Warning System** using **YOLOv11** for real-time object detection and alert generation. The system is designed to detect unauthorized intrusions in restricted areas (e.g., factories, warehouses, or private properties) using video streams or CCTV feeds.

Key features:
- Real-time detection of intruders.
- Alerts generation upon detecting suspicious activities.
- High accuracy using YOLOv11 detection backbone.
- Optional integration with DeepSORT for multi-object tracking (MOT).
## Running
